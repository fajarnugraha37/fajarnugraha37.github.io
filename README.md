> "Because you need a multi-layer WASM laboratory just to render a blog post. Allegedly."

A high-tech, low-life portfolio and laboratory environment. Built with the "boring" production stack that definitely isn't boring once you look under the hood. No heroics, just pure engineering.

---

## HYBRID_ARCHITECTURE (READ/WRITE)

The system operates in two distinct logical modes controlled by the `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_MODE` environment variable.

### 1. READ_MODE (Static / Production)
- **Engine:** SSG (Static Site Generation).
- **Deployment:** Optimized for GitHub Pages (`/out` export).
- **Data:** Consumes static indices (`assets-index.json`, `search-index.json`) and pre-rendered MDX.
- **Security:** Immutable. All write-based APIs are disabled and UI components are sanitized/locked.

### 2. WRITE_MODE (Dynamic / CMS)
- **Engine:** SSR (Server-Side Rendering) + API Routes.
- **Deployment:** Localhost / Docker environment.
- **Data:** Direct access to the local filesystem via Node.js API routes.
- **Features:** Full CRUD enabled. Create, edit, and delete blogs or assets directly from the UI. Changes persist to the `/content` and `/public/assets` directories.

---

## THE_TECH_STACK

Running on the latest stable firmware:

- **Framework:** [Next.js 16](https://nextjs.org/) (Static Export Mode)
- **Runtime:** [React 19](https://react.dev/) (Concurrent by default)
- **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/) (The one with the new engine)
- **Engine:** [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (Fast. Faster than you. Definitely faster than my internet.)
- **Persistence:** `localStorage` Buffers + WASM Database Nodes.
- **Infrastructure:** Docker + Nginx (The old guard) + GitHub Actions.

---

## LABORATORY_NODES

The site isn't just text; it's a series of experimental laboratories:

### 1. SQL_TERMINAL (PostgreSQL WASM)

- Powered by [PGlite](https://pglite.dev/).
- A full PostgreSQL instance running directly in your browser's memory.
- No backend. No cloud. Just pure client-side relational power.

### 2. DATA_ANALYTICS (DuckDB WASM)

- High-performance analytical queries on Parquet datasets.
- Fast enough to make your fans spin (if you have them).
- Visualize data without leaving the DOM.

### 3. MARKDOWN.EXE (The Advanced Editor)

- **VIM_MODE:** Because using a mouse is a failure of imagination.
- **Sync_Scroll:** Keep your source and preview in perfect alignment.
- **Content_Editor (Write Mode Only):** In write mode, access the Content Database to search, open, save, and delete actual `.mdx` blogs directly to the filesystem. Built-in metadata (frontmatter) management via a Cyberpunk Accordion UI.
- **GitHub_Alerts:** Full support for `[!NOTE]`, `[!TIP]`, and more.
- **Exporters:** Static HTML and PDF Report generation integrated.
- **Security:** DOMPurify sanitization. High-fidelity, zero-trust.

### 4. MEDIA PROCESSOR.EXE (FFmpeg WASM)

- High-performance client-side media transcoding and signal processing.
- Features Video to GIF generation with 2-pass palette optimization.
- Audio extraction, video compression, and fast-seeking segment trimming.
- Fully multithreaded operations running entirely in the browser. Zero server uploads.

### 5. TRANSLATION NODE.EXE (ONNX Runtime / Transformers)

- Client-side NLLB-200 machine translation.
- Zero-server inference running securely in the browser.
- Supports multiple languages: English, Indonesian, Chinese (Simplified), Spanish, Arabic, Malay, Japanese, Korean, German, Dutch, Russian.
- Dynamic environment-based model loading (local filesystem in dev, CDN in production) to save bandwidth.

## SYSTEM_STRUCTURE

Adheres to strict **Atomic Design** principles for UI scalability:

```bash
/app          # The Routing Matrix (App Router 16)
/components   # Modular Hardware
  /atoms      # Primitives (Button, Toast, AnimatedNumber)
  /molecules  # Functional Blocks (BlogCard, Search, Tabs)
  /organisms  # Orchestrated Sections (Header, Hero, LabContent)
/content      # Encrypted Archives (MDX Blogs)
/hooks        # Headless Logic (useMarkdown, useTerminal, useFFmpegCore)
/labs         # Experimental Chambers (SQL, MD, DuckDB, FFmpeg)
/lib          # Core Utilities & Static Data
/public       # Static Assets, Datasets & Web Workers (coi-serviceworker)
/scripts      # Build-time automation (pre-build/post-build)
/types        # Global API Contracts (Strongly Typed)
```

---

## LOCAL_UPLINK

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (Required. Node is legacy now.)
- A terminal with a dark background.

### 1. Initialize_System

```bash
bun install
```

### 2. Boot_Environment

```bash
bun dev
```

### 3. Build_Production_Artifacts

```bash
bun run build
```

*Note: The `build` script automatically triggers `pre-build` to generate search indices and asset manifests.*

## ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES

The system behavior is controlled by the following centralized environment variables (configured in `lib/env.ts`):

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_MODE`: Controls the mode of the application. Set to `write` to enable SSR and the Content Editor API routes for managing markdown blogs. Defaults to `read` (SSG / Static Export Mode) which disables data-mutating APIs.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`: The base URL of the deployment (used for SEO, metadata, and RSS feed). Defaults to `https://fajarnugraha37.github.io`.
- `DISABLE_HMR`: Set to `true` to disable Hot Module Replacement in dev mode.
- `NODE_ENV`: Standard environment flag (`development`, `production`).

---

## DEPLOYMENT_PROTOCOLS

The system auto-deploys via GitHub Actions to Pages upon every push to `main`.

**GitHub Pages & WASM Multithreading (The COOP/COEP):**
GitHub Pages does not natively support setting custom `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy` (COOP) and `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy` (COEP) HTTP headers. These headers are strictly required by browsers to enable `SharedArrayBuffer`, which FFmpeg-WASM needs for multithreading.
To bypass this limitation, this project uses the [coi-serviceworker](https://github.com/gzuidhof/coi-serviceworker) library. A local service worker (`public/coi-serviceworker.js`) intercepts the initial page load and injects the necessary security headers into the browser's response, allowing full multithreading capabilities on a static host.

**GTM_TRACKING_INJECTION:**
To activate analytics tracking:
1. **Local Setup:** Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_GTM_ID=GTM-XXXXXXX` to your `.env.local`.
2. **Production Setup:** In your GitHub Repository, navigate to **Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions** and add a new repository secret named `NEXT_PUBLIC_GTM_ID` with your container ID as the value. The CI/CD pipeline will automatically inject it during the build phase.

**The Docker Routine:**

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

Standard Nginx config provided. Static files served at port 80. Simple. Boring. Production-ready.
